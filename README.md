# [ *another* ] PlantApp
___

I am a proud plant dad with lots of experience, but even I don't always know what certain plants require. 
I have tried a lot of different plant apps and all of them have a ton of unnecessary functions and ads, which makes
the life of a user miserable. I wanted to make something very specific, something that would finally help me and my
fellow plant parents.

Here is the design so far, it is pretty raw at the moment, and it is evolving as I go. I choose some base colors including 
background color, main color, first accent color and a second one. Design was inspired by CodeCademy with some elements 
that I used in my previous works. I decided to go with minimal and clean (cause there's no time to play around with colors 
and shapes).

## I have separated desired functionality according to MOSCOW rule

#### Must-have:
- Fetches data from a plant API and renders the output on a separate page
- Features loading animations
- Renders error messages for users
- LOOKS GOOD
#### Should-have:
- Loading animation on initialization
- Showing search suggestions and features a user-friendly logic behind it
- Renders images and has nice visuals for the plant page
#### Could-have:
- Feeling lucky button functionality, where it fetches data and randomly chooses a plant from database
- Smooth animations and amazing UI
- About page with extra info and links
- Hardness map
- Simple yet informative plant page (card style)
