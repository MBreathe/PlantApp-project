# [another]PlantApp
___

I am a proud plant dad with lots of experience, but even I don't always know what certain plants require. 
I have tried a lot of different plant apps and all of them have a ton of unnecessary functions and ads, which makes
the life of a user miserable. I wanted to make something very specific, something that would finally help me and my
fellow plant dads (AND MOMS TOO(AND NON-BINARY PARENTS)).
